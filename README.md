## Question 1: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
It is an efficient way to run test cases automatically when pushing our code. Github action is also secure since the code won't be pushed if failed the automated tests beforehand. Therefore, this is the best approach for automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline.

## Question 2: No
Because End-to-End testing is for testing the functionality, including buttons, input-text. Unit testing should be used instead.
